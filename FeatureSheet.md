# Introduction #
**metal-jax** is a JavaScript OOP framework with a simple and intuitive programming model. The framework promotes class-based OOP practices in JavaScript such as encapsulation and inheritance, which usually result in more understandable and reusable code. The class-based OOP style offered by the framework is different, and probably more natural to a Java developer than most other JavaScript framework styles. The framework also provides a small set of base API and annotations to aid creation of modular JavaScript code, and even modular HTML code in a webapp.
